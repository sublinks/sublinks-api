# Reporting Security Issues

The Sublinks team and community take security bugs in Sublinks seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/sublinks/sublinks-api/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Sublinks Core Owner team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party libraries/modules to the person or team maintaining the library/module.
